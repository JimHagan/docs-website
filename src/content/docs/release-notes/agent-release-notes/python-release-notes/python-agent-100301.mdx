## Notes

This release of the Python agent fixes a bug in the package version collector that disabled telemetry from being sent to New Relic in certain cases.
 
Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the [New Relic download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).
    
## Bug fixes

* Fix package version uploading logic

  * Previously, if the package's versioning mechanism was a class property, the function itself would get sent into the payload, so the environment stats would show the `__repr__()` of the versioning class. Once this task was tweaked and moved to the harvest cycle in v10.3.0, this resulted in a failed harvest cycle, which effectively disabled any telemetry from being sent. This release adds logic to prevent anything that's not a valid data type from being sent within the module payload.
  
## Support statement

We recommend updating to the latest agent version as soon as it's available. If you can't upgrade to the latest version, update your agents to a version no more than 90 days old. Read [more](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/update-new-relic-agent/) about keeping agents up to date.

See the New Relic Python agent [EOL policy](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-eol-policy/) for information about agent releases and support dates.
