## Overview [#overview]

Data ingest governance is a practice of ensuring optimal value for telemetry data collected by an organization particulary a complex organization with numerous business units and working groups.  The objective is get appropriate ROI for investimate in telemetry data.

The New Relic framework is built around several separate modules that can be adopted independently or as part of a complete practice.  These include:

- [Baselining](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining)
- Optimizing <font color="green">   - coming soon!</font>
- Forecasting <font color="green">   - coming soon!</font>

## Desired outcome [#desired-outcome]


When executed properly this framework will allow us to move beyond reactive efforts to reduce and troubleshoot unexplained increases or low value telemetry.  This value driven approach is the ultimate goal of *observability maturity*.

We can summarize the benefits of this exercise as follows

### Nose Reduction

One aim of data ingest governance is to reduce what we call "noise" in data streams.  This will follow on by the introduction of metadata standards and also through out value based approach to telemetry we may be able to reduce unnecessary redundancy.  As part of the right sizing process we will often drop unnecessary attributes and metadata from an otherwise valuable data source.  By creating baseline reports, conducting optimization and forecasting exercises we will ensure that our data ingest volume is always giving observabililty value to our organization and.

### Organizational Alignment

Complex organizations often struggle understanding exactly which groups within the org or contributing which data to the telemetry platform.  This process aims to provide a method to raise visibility of the sources of telemetry and to enable organizations to reduce silo-ization in the management of observability data.

### Alignment of Ingested Data With Observability Objectives

<Callout variant="tip">
This is a good time to familiarize yourself with the [observability maturity principles](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/introduction/).  This will make the concept of `value` more concrete from an observability standpoint.

When we introduce new telemetry we will want to understand what it delivers to our overall observability solution.  This is critically important in optimization and forecasting where we may need to deal with tradeoffs of having or not having a certain telemetry.

Observability objectives include:

- Tracking an Internal SLA
- Tracking an External SLA
- Supporting Feature Innovation (A/B Perfomance & Adoption Testing)
- Monitoring Customer Experience
- Business Process Monitoring
- Compliance Requirements

Alignment to these objectives are what allow us to make flexible and intuitive decisions about prioritizing one set of data over another and helping guide teams know where to start when instrumenting new platforms and services.
