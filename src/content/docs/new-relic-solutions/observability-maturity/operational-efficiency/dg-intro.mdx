## Overview [#overview]

Data ingest governance is the practice of ensuring optimal value for telemetry data collected. This practice is especially important to complex organizations with numerous business units and working groups. This guide is for readers who need granularity that goes beyond the [data management views](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data/) in New Relic One.

## Desired outcome [#desired-outcome]
 
Ensure a high return on investment in telemetry data.

Reduce redundant or unnecessary data with confidence.

Understand exactly which groups within the org are contributing which data. Expose where your telemetry data is coming from and reduce data management silos.

Account for ingest costs in a clear and concise way.  Adjust your ingest volume with full context of the observability value of the data.

## Process [#process]
This guide is built around several modules that should be adopted in order as part of a complete practice.  These include:

- [Establish data ingest management roles and practices](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-coe)
- [Baseline your ingest data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining) - Analyze your organization's current data ingest rates.
- [Optimize your ingest data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-optimizing) - Right-size your data ingest
- Forecast your ingest data - Estimate future data ingest rates <font color="green"><sup>coming soon!</sup></font>
