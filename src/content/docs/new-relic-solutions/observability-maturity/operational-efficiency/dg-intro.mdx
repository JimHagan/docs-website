## Overview [#overview]

Data ingest governance is a practice of ensuring optimal value for telemetry data collected by an organization particulary a complex organization with numerous business units and working groups.  The objective is get appropriate ROI for investimate in telemetry data.

The New Relic framework is built around several separate modules that can be adopted independently or as part of a complete practice.  These include:

- [Baselining](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining) - Analyze your organization's current data ingest rates.
- Optimizing - Right-size your data ingest <font color="green"><sup>coming soon!</sup></font>
- Forecasting - Estimate future data ingest rates <font color="green"><sup>coming soon!</sup></font>

## Desired outcomes [#desired-outcome]


### Noise Reduction

As part of the data governance process we will develop the knowledge and confidence to reduce redundant data or data that is not necessary for our observability goals.

### Increased Transparency

Complex organizations often struggle understanding exactly which groups within the org or contributing which data to the telemetry platform.  This process aims to provide a method to raise visibility of the sources of telemetry and to enable organizations to reduce *silos* in the management of observability data.

### Cost Optimization & Predictability

Data ingest governance allows us to account for our ingest costs in a clear and concise way.  It also provides us with practical tools for adjusting our ingest volume with full context of the observability value of the data.  Taken together *Baselining*, *Optimizing*, and *Forecasting* Forecasting give us a complete tool kit to reduce suprises and to plan further into the future.
