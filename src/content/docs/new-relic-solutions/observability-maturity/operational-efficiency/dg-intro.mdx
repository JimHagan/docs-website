## Overview [#overview]

Data ingest governance is the practice of ensuring optimal value for telemetry data collected. This practice is especially important to complex organizations with numerous business units and working groups. The objective is to get the appropriate ROI for investiment in telemetry data.

This guide is built around several separate modules that can be adopted independently or as part of a complete practice.  These include:

- [Baseline your ingest data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/dg-baselining) - Analyze your organization's current data ingest rates.
- Optimize your ingest data - Right-size your data ingest <font color="green"><sup>coming soon!</sup></font>
- Forecast your ingest data - Estimate future data ingest rates <font color="green"><sup>coming soon!</sup></font>

## Desired outcomes [#desired-outcome]

### Noise Reduction

As part of the data governance process you will develop the knowledge and confidence to reduce data that is redundant or not necessary for your observability goals.

### Increased Transparency

Complex organizations often struggle to understand exactly which groups within the org are contributing which data.  This process aims to provide a method to raise visibility of the sources of telemetry and to enable organizations to reduce *silos* in the management of observability data.

### Cost Optimization & Predictability

Data ingest governance allows you to account for our ingest costs in a clear and concise way.  It also provides you with practical tools for adjusting your ingest volume with full context of the observability value of the data.  Taken together, *Baseline your ingest data*, *Optimize your ingest data*, and *Forecast your ingest data* give you a complete tool kit to reduce suprises and to plan further into the future.
