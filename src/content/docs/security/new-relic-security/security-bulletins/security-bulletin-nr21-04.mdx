If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45.  This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57.

## Action items [#action]

To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45.

<Callout variant="important">
If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) [version 3.0.55](/docs/release-notes/synthetics-release-notes/containerized-private-minions-release-notes/containerized-private-minion-cpm-3055/), Apache Foundation's current [technical guidance](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#CVE-2021-44228) is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time.
</Callout>

This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to [NR21-03](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-03) for more information.

**Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page for remediation details that should be considered.**
