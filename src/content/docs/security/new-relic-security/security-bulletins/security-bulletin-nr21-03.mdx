## Action items [#action]

To remediate both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 6.5.2 (requires Java 7 or higher) or 7.4.2 (requires Java 8 or higher) as soon as possible.

If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, these agent versions are using log4j2 version 2.15.0. However Apache Foundation's current [technical guidance](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#CVE-2021-44228) is that log4j2 v2.15.0 has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We recommend updating or implementing the additional workaround below at this time.

<Callout variant="important">
If you are on an earlier or affected version of the agent, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we strongly recommend you disable the Java agent logging.
</Callout>

### How to disable the Java agent logging [#disable]

You can set your Java agent logging level to `OFF` to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options:

* Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the `log_level` parameter).
* Define the `newrelic.config.log_level=OFF` system property.
* Set the `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF` environment variable.

Then restart your application.

After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written.

**Note:** This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version.

We will share more information, and additional steps for remediation, if the situation changes.

**If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html). This page provides remediation details for you to consider.**

### Containerized private minions [#CPM]

The above step will remediate your New Relic Java agent only. You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minion. Please refer to [NR21-04](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-04/) for more information.

  Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j 2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. Java agents 6.5.2 and 7.4.2 are the only Java agent versions currently available with log4j 2.16.0.
